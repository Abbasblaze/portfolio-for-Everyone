            <p>
                I am actively seeking opportunities to apply my acquired skills and knowledge to real-world projects. 
                My educational background has equipped me with a solid foundation in AI and ML algorithms, data analysis, 
                and programming languages such as Python. Additionally, I have gained practical experience through hands-on 
                projects, both independently and collaboratively.
            </p>
